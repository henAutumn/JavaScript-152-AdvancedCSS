# 1.0 Overview

---

CSS Flexbox and Grid tools, allow us to separate content and presentation.  
They give an independence to our content that we didn't have before but we need now, and forever, going forward.

Grids: can layer items, explicitly state where an element sits on the grid and even mix items with explicit positioning with those that will layout according to Grid's auto-placement algorithm.  Great value in using sub-grids within grids. declare elements on the grid as sub grid.

remember:

  
general info: odds are you won't even think about precedence in CSS. It doesn't come up a whole heck of a lot. But it does matter! It comes up any time multiple CSS selectors match and element with the exact same [specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/).

Assuming specificity is exactly the same, order **does **matter.

Styles declared **later **win.
