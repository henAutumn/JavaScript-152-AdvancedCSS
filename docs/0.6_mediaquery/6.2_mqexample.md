# Working with Media Queries



Open your flexbox layout code. add the following code to it. This is actually coded in mobile-first approach.

```css
/* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach
* in this case:
* 1. header
* 2. article/main
* 3. aside 1
* 4. aside 2
* 5. footer
*/

/* Medium screens */
@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
/* We tell both sidebars to share a row */
.aside { flex: 1 auto; }
}

/* Large screens */
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
/* We invert order of first sidebar and main
* And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars
*/
.main { flex: 2 0px; }
.aside-1 { order: 1; }
.main { order: 2; }
.aside-2 { order: 3; }
.footer { order: 4; }
}
```

>You can reorder grids \(and flexboxes to a lesser degree\) but be wary of user experience varying from mobile to desktop and vice versa\(mouse vs touch\) and consider vertical mq's making sure content fits in height without user needing to scroll. for example- another UX consideration is pointer type \(mouse vs touch\) [https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/)  has example code to test for this.  any-poniter/any-hover brings in future of voice activated UX

Next up is mq 4 as everything else always evolving.

Keep an eye/ears open for Element Queries. Element queries target elements instead of browser. On the horizon. @mixin \(adv\)
