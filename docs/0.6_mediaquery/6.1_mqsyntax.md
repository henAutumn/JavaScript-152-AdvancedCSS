### Syntax

`@media type and (expression){`

`specific styling here`

`}`

media query syntax is made up by a media type and zero or more expressions.

| Examples of Types | Examples of Expressions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **all** \(all devices listen to this\) | width \(of current window\) |
| **print** \(paged material & docs viewed in print preview mode\) | height \(of current window\) |
| **projection** \(projected presentations i.e. projectors\) | device-width \(width of the device/ENTIRE screen. may not always match viewport layout\) |
| **screen **\(color computer screens & smartphones\) | device-height \(height of the device\) |
| **braille** \(braille tactile feedback devices\) | orientation \(landscape or portrait\) |

or a more efficient way . . .

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' media='all' href='normal.css'/>
<link rel='stylesheet' media='print' href='print.css'/>
<link rel='stylesheet' media='screen and (min-width: 701px)' href='medium.css'/>
```

Linking the media query in the &lt;head&gt; is more efficient because it will only call the size needed instead of loading all rules to meet all requirements.

Media queries The most effective media queries are those that target the viewport's width and height.
