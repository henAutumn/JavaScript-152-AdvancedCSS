# 6.0 Media Queries

---

We started off learning about flexbox \(and adaptable with flex-grow\(wrap\) and grids, as these are inherently responsive. However, with the ever evolving world of devices it is vitally important that your site content looks good, and exactly the way you want to present it, on any viewport size.

For example, there are wearables, HD 27" Monitors, printers, tablet in landscape and portrait mode. These are just a few examples but I think you get the gist of problem. Have no fear, media queries are here!

Media queries allow us to tell the browser, by tweaking the CSS rules, how to display our content depending on the size and type of the viewport.

### Media Queries

* adjust styling
* based on dimensions
* can detect viewport width
* color, color index, aspect ration, width, display width, height, display height, orientation, monochrome, resolution, scan, pixel-density

---

Essentially, media queries are used to "break" your layout no matter the screen size. Which helps sites load faster \(a necessity in an impatient world\). We call these "breaks" **breakpoints**.

When you think about using **breakpoints**, base them on the design, not on a specific device; however, keep in mind the three\(3\) core breakpoints:

* small - applies to all screens
* medium - covers 640px or wider
* large - 1024px or wider.

Every device and platform specific adjustment made creates the potential for risk.

Sites consist of 2 components; the "thing" or \(main event\) and then other stuffs\(ads, related pictures, articles, widgets\). You want to **prioritize** primary content while providing access to the supplementals.

Use **match media** allows js to capitalize on all media queries goodness chunking HTML that aren't the thing and them pulling them in when conditions are right.

### EXPLORE MORE

* pixel-density will become increasingly more important as it conditionally serves larger background images and icon sprites for Retina and other hi-res screens.

* orientation might be used to conditionally disable fixed positioning to free up screen real estate.

  Just as an aside, media queries work really well with grids.

on sites there are THe thing \(main event\) and then other stuffs\(ads, related picures, articles, widgets\) priotize primary content but provide access to supplemental stuffs. use match media allows js to capitalize on all media queries goodness chunking HTML that aren't the thing and them pulling them in when conditions are right.

keep it simple stupid . less is more. instead it is an appeal for simplicity and elegance: putting commonality first, approaching differentiation carefully, and advocating for consistency in the creation and application of web standards.

Getting to this less-is-more future web involves, in part:

* Integrating what we’ve been learning on the mobile web—“mobile first” design practices, performance focus, progressive enhancement, and, yep, Responsive Web Design—into the future of our overall web crafting tool kits;
* Understanding the difference between inspired details and distracting minutiae, and assuring what we  
  _do_

  do has impact;

* Introducing less risk, or managing the risk we introduce—because each workaround or device-specific tweak we make introduces risk;
* Putting more oomph and involvement behind our requests for the reliable support of web standards in browsers and
  [across platforms](http://alistapart.com/column/the-web-on-mobile-and-beyond)
  , while making sure we’re learning and using the web standards we’re asking for; and
* Realizing when things aren’t in our bailiwick and getting ourselves off the hook for every technical eventuality. - Lyza Danger Gardner

useful for altering layouts using media queries\(term link\) and adapting to different contexts.\*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.\*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewport.\*  
In the first chapter you created a basic site using grids.  We are going to take that layout and manually set the points at which the layout will change according to the size of the viewport.

Breakpoints:

7 - habits by highly effective media queries \(brad frost\) mobile first design styles are smaller and more maintainable code

minor vs major breakpoints

major- when 1 column becomes 2, 2 becomes 3

minor - points at where one element might need to be modified

avoid pixel based media queries - use relative units

interaction media features \(list examples of additional terms\)

shorthand syntax to indicate range @media \(40em &lt;= width &lt;= 59em \) same as @ media \(min-width: 40em\) and \(max-width: 59em\)

utilize the 'responsive' mode in Chrome DevTools

If you need to experience CSS breakpoints for screen sizes bigger than the monitor you’re sitting at, use the ‘responsive’ mode in Chrome DevTools and type in whatever giant size you like.

1. The blue bar shows ‘max-width’ media queries, the orange bar is ‘min-width’ media queries, and the green bar shows media queries with both a min and a max.
2. Clicking a media query sets the screen to that width. If you click on a green media query more than once, it toggles between the max and min widths.
3. Right click a media query in the media queries bar to go to the definition of that rule in the CSS.

Below, multi-column layout will only make columns if there is enough space to have two`15em`columns, and so doesn’t need a width media query to make it behave in a responsive manner. I have added a`min-height`media query, to text for a reasonable height before kicking in the columns. If this is a small screen in landscape mode, I’ll only show one column so the user can scroll down to read. \(Rachel Adams\)

```css
@media(min-height: 500px){
  section
  {
    column-width: 15 em;
  }
}
```

When do I use breakpoints

Add different styles at these breakpoints so you can see that it not only can change size but font, color, order, as well.

“For reference, you should know that the iPhone 4 has a regular screen layout viewport of 640×960. This means that, in this example, the device-width of the iPhone4 is 320×480. This is the case because Apple realizes that not every website is built responsively \(shame on them\) and tries to please everyone by having around 980px width to accommodate the desktop view of the website. This means, that if there is no meta viewport tag in place, the iPhone4 will take your website, render it as if it were 980px wide, squish it into a 320px display, and as a result, would be zoomed out to the user.” - Ryan Reese \(SitePoint article\) on device-width vs width

while mobile-first is up for debate - I'm in the pro camp.
