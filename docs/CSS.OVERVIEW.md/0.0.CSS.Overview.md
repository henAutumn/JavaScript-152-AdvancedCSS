# CSS OVERVIEW

CSS in general

Source order matters : source order of html of a page can affect users when CSS re-orders visually.  source-order vs display order not unique to flexbox and grids.

  for examples of flexbox order none order.

  Grids: can layer items, explicitly state where an element sits on the grid and even mix items with explicit positioning with those that will layout according to Grid's auto-placement algorithm.  Great value in using sub-grids within grids. declare elements on the grid as subgrid.

Topics we will cover:

flexbox
grids
borders
shapes
colors
gradients
positioning
media queries
floats
transitions
animations
transformations

This is really an intermediate course in CSS.  There is much more to CSS than what is contained here and much of what we do cover can be explored even further. Hopefully this gives you information and excites yoy enough to dig deeper or stay abreast of future happenings on the CSS future.

remember:
general info: odds are you won't even think about precedence in CSS. It doesn't come up a whole heck of a lot. But it does matter! It comes up any time multiple CSS selectors match and element with the exact same[specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/).

Assuming specificity is exactly the same, order_does_matter.
