\# Units of Length

CSS has two\(2\) types of units of length: relative and absolute.  You are familiar with pixels\(px\) and percentage\(%\)

relative:

**fr **is a flexible fractional unit which represents a _fraction of the space available_.

**em - relative to the font-size of the element\(2em means 2 times the size of the current font\)**

ex- to x-height of the current font\(rarely used\)

ch - relative to the width of zero"0"

rem - relative to font-size of the root element

vw- rel to 1% of the width of viewport \(ex. if viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw=0.5cm\)

vh - rel to 1% of height of viewport\(browser window size\)

vmin, vmax-relative to 1% of viewport's smaller/larger dimension

rem & em are practical in creating perfectly scalable layouts

absolute lengths: these are fixed and will appear exactly that size \(best not to use these for anything other than print in which you know the output medium and size.

cm - centimeters

mm - millimeters

in - inches

px\* -pixels\(1px = 1/96th of 1in\)

pt - points\(1pt = 1/72 of 1in\)

pc - picas \(1pc = 12 pt\)
