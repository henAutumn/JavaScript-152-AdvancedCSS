# Part 1: FLEXBOXES & GRIDS

Although similar, Grids and Flexboxes are different, and while neither is better than the other, it is best to think about them as complementing each other. 

Flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts - anything that needs to be laid out in a straight line (or in a broken line, which would be a single straight line if they were joined back together). Grid is for two-dimensional layouts. It can be used as a low-powered flexbox substitute (we’re trying to make sure that a single-column/row grid acts very similar to a flexbox), but that’s not using its full power.

 Container (parent)
 Item (child)
 Direction
 
    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column reverse;
        row(default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
        row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
        column: same as row but top to bottom
        column-reverse: bottom to top
    flex-wrap: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
        no-wrap(default): all items will be on 1 line
        wrap: items will wrap onto multiple lines, top to bottom
        wrap-reverse: wrap from bottom to top
    flex-flow: <'flex-direction'> || <'flex-wrap'>; shorthand for direction & wrap (applies only to parent)*
    
justify-content: alignment along main-axis - distributes extra fee space when either flex items are inflexible or are flexible but have reached their max size. Also, exerts some control over the alighment of items when they overflow the line.*
        flex-start(default) items packed to(adjacent?abuts?) start line
        flex-end: toward end line
        center: centered along line
        space-between: even distribution in line; first item on start line, last item on end line
        space-around: evenly distributed with equal space around (items are not visually equal. Not 1st item will have 1 unit(?)of space against the start line but 2 units between next item)
        space-evenly: distributed between 2 items and space to edges is equal*

Align-items: (think justify-content for cross-axis(perpendicular to main axis))*
        flex-start-cross: start margin edge of item is placed on cross-start line
        flex-end: item edge against cross-line end
        center: items centered across cross-axis
        baseline: item baselines are aligned
        stretch(default): stretch to fill container(still respecting min/max-width)
        
Align-content: aligns container* lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis(similar to justify-content aligns individual items within the main axis)

**NOTE** Flexboxes require vendor prefixes (see: scss) run through Autoprefixer(link: https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/)

  @include flex(1 200px);
  @include order(2);

## GRIDS



Grids provide a structured layout in CSS
Is useful for altering layouts using media queries(term link) and adapting to different contexts.*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewports.*




### Terminology

use flexbox for flexibility with a row or a column
use grid for 2D layouts

grid lines - lines that make up the grid. Horz or vert. referred to by name or number

grid track - space between 2 grid lines. Hor or vert.

grid cell - space between 4 grid lines. Smallest unit on grid that can hold items (like cells in a table)

grid area - on the grid, bound by 4 grid lines containing any number of cells

grid-container
    grid-template-rows
    grid-template-columns
    grid-template-areas
