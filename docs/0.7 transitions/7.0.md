# Part 7.0 Transitions

CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.

---

The transition property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties:
```
.example {
    transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
}
```

##CSS Transition Properties
The following table lists all the CSS transition properties:

    Property | Description
    ------------ | -------------
    transition | A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
    transition-delay | Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
    transition-duration | Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
    transition-property | Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
    transition-timing-function | Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
