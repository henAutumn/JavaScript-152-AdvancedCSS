# 5.3 Position: Fixed

---

#### An element given a _fixed_ position

* Will be isolated, relative to the document
* Unaffected by scrolling

---

Add the following to your code

```html
<div class="rectangleLightBlue"></div>
```

```css
.wrapper{
  margin: 100px;
}
.rectangleLightBlue{
  margin: 0px;
  width: 792px;
  height: 100px;
  position: fixed;
  background: lightblue;
  top: 105px;
}
```

You should have a rectangle spanning the box that stays in the same spot when you scroll the page up and down.

Navigation bars are elements/features that often assigned a **fixed** position.
