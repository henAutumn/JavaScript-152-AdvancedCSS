# 5.1 Static

---

An element that has a position of *relative*

* Will remain on the page according to normal flow of page.
* It _WILL NOT_ be affected by other positional properties and values.

Working off the same code that we just did in 5.1, make the following changes

1. comment out squareRed
2. add a margin of 100px to class squareBlack

Experiment with different values for the margin, top and left properties. Then try the following margin values: 300px, 50px, 0px

Now try these values for the top property: 550px, 50px, 0px

What did you observe about the black square? The red square? What was the black square relative to?
