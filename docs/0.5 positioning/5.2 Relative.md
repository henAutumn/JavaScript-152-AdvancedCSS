Experiment with different values for the **margin**, **top** and **left** properties.

Then try the following **margin** values:

* 300px
* 50px
* 0px

Now, leaving the **margin** at 0px, try these values for the **top** property:

* 550px
* 50px
* 0px

Experiment with changing both the **margin** and **top** values together.
