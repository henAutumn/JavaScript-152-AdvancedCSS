# 2.0 Borders and Shapes

---

Corners. Corners are sharp. Corners are harsh. Now we are going to soften things up! This won't take very long.

## Prep: copy and paste HTML

```html
<!--rounded corners example-->
  <div class="wrap">
  <div class="softie"></div>
  </div>

<!--targeted corners example-->
  <div class="wrap">
  <div class="picasso"></div>
  </div>

<!--ellipse/oval-->
  <div class="wrap">
  <div class="egg"></div>
  </div>

<!--shape experiment-->
  <div class="wrap">
  <div class="wonder"></div>
  </div>


  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="circ1">
        <div class="circ2">
        </div>
    </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

## Border radius

We'll make a square and round the corners by adding border-radius property. [Shapes HTML](Code: Shapes)

```css
.softie{
  background: orange;
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

You should have created a orange box with rounded corners.  Notice how we didn't have a border on our square? You don't need a border, but you could have a border if you wanted one.

 That is super nifty BUT we can go farther. We can use multiple values to create all sorts of shapes.

Let's try it out.

```css
.picasso{
  background: navy;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-top-left-radius: 20px;
  border-top-right-radius: 30px;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 5px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 65px;
}
```

Does your shape look like this

Take a few minutes to play around with different values.
