Grids provide a structured layout in CSS
Is useful for altering layouts using media queries(term link) and adapting to different contexts.*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewports.*
