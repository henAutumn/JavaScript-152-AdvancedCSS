# 6.0 Media Queries

---

  
Is useful for altering layouts using media queries\(term link\) and adapting to different contexts.\*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.\*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewports.\*  
In the first chapter you created a basic site using grids.  We are going to take that layout and manually set the points at which the layout will change according to the size of the viewport.

Media queries



go back to your flexbox layout code. add the following code to it. This is actually coded in mobile-first approach. 

```css
/* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach
* in this case:
* 1. header
* 2. article/main
* 3. aside 1
* 4. aside 2
* 5. footer
*/

/* Medium screens */
@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
/* We tell both sidebars to share a row */
.aside { flex: 1 auto; }
}
/* Large screens */
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
/* We invert order of first sidebar and main
* And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars
*/
.main { flex: 2 0px; }
.aside-1 { order: 1; }
.main { order: 2; }
.aside-2 { order: 3; }
.footer { order: 4; }
}
```
