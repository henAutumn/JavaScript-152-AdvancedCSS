# 6.0 Media Queries

---

There are a zillion devices of varying sizes. You need to make sure that your site looks good, and exactly how you want it to, on every single one of those screens.  Have no fear, media queries are here!  Media queries allow us to tell the browser how to display our content depending on the size of the viewport.

When you are designing a site, the best practice is to take is a mobile-first approach, meaning that you design for a small viewport, such as a mobile phone.  Why? It is easier to alter elements and layouts to fit in a larger viewport than it is to go the opposite direction. 



s useful for altering layouts using media queries\(term link\) and adapting to different contexts.\*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.\*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewports.\*  
In the first chapter you created a basic site using grids.  We are going to take that layout and manually set the points at which the layout will change according to the size of the viewport.

Media queries

go back to your flexbox layout code. add the following code to it. This is actually coded in mobile-first approach.

```css
/* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach
* in this case:
* 1. header
* 2. article/main
* 3. aside 1
* 4. aside 2
* 5. footer
*/

/* Medium screens */
@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
/* We tell both sidebars to share a row */
.aside { flex: 1 auto; }
}
/* Large screens */
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
/* We invert order of first sidebar and main
* And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars
*/
.main { flex: 2 0px; }
.aside-1 { order: 1; }
.main { order: 2; }
.aside-2 { order: 3; }
.footer { order: 4; }
}
```
