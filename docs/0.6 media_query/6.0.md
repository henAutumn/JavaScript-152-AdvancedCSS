# 6.0 Media Queries

---

There are a zillion devices that your site needs to look good on and exactly the way you want to present it. For example, an iPhone 7s screen or an HD 27" Monitor,  a printer or tablet in landscape and portrait mode. These are just a few examples but I think you get the gist of problem.  Have no fear, media queries are here!  Media queries allow us to tell the browser, by tweaking the CSS rules, how to display our content depending on the size and type of the viewport.

When you are designing, the best practice is to take is a mobile-first approach, meaning that you design for a small viewport, such as a mobile phone.  Why? It is easier to alter elements and layouts to fit in a larger viewport than it is to go the opposite direction.

### Syntax

media query syntax is made up by a media type and zero or more expressions.



| Examples of Types | Examples of Expressions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **all** \(all devices listen to this\) | width \(of current window\) |
| **print** \(paged material & docs viewed in print preview mode\) | height \(of current window\) |
| **projection** \(projected presentations i.e. projectors\) | device-width \(width of the device\) |
| **screen **\(color computer screens & smartphones\) | device-height \(height of the device\) |
| **braille** \(braille tactile feedback devices\) | orientation \(landscape or portra |



```css
// style
#header-image{
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-image: url('image.gif');
   }

// show a larger image when you're on a big screen
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px){
   #header-image{
   background-image: url('large-image.gif');
   }
}
 
// remove header image when printing
@media print {
   #header-image{
   display: none;
   }
}
```

or a more efficient way . . .

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' media='all' href='normal.css'/>
<link rel='stylesheet' media='print' href='print.css'/>
<link rel='stylesheet' media='screen and (min-width: 701px)' href='medium.css'/>
```

Linking the media query in the &lt;head&gt; is more effcient because it only access the size it needs instead of loading all rules to meet all requirements.



Choose your breakpoints based on your design NOT on specific device, but there may be occurences where a certain device is just not cooperating and you just need a little help with this certain device.

useful for altering layouts using media queries\(term link\) and adapting to different contexts.\*

Its a way to separate order of elements in the source from their visual presentation.\*

What it means to you: free to change location of page elements as is best for your layout at different breakpoints

Each element has its own grid area which will prevent overlapping due to text size changes, increase in content or small viewports.\*  
In the first chapter you created a basic site using grids.  We are going to take that layout and manually set the points at which the layout will change according to the size of the viewport.

Media queries

go back to your flexbox layout code. add the following code to it. This is actually coded in mobile-first approach.

```css
/* We rely on source order for mobile-first approach
* in this case:
* 1. header
* 2. article/main
* 3. aside 1
* 4. aside 2
* 5. footer
*/

/* Medium screens */
@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
/* We tell both sidebars to share a row */
.aside { flex: 1 auto; }
}
/* Large screens */
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
/* We invert order of first sidebar and main
* And tell the main element to take twice as much width as the other two sidebars
*/
.main { flex: 2 0px; }
.aside-1 { order: 1; }
.main { order: 2; }
.aside-2 { order: 3; }
.footer { order: 4; }
}
```
