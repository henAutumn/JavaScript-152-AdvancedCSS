---

User empathy and understanding are vital to the success of any product. Consider changing set of behaviors, preferences, goals, global cultural differences\(ex. Nova car\).  **UI** and **UX** makes a product more useful, understandable, usable and beautiful.

user: who does user want to be? what does user want to do? how does user want to feel?

design fundamentals - shape, color, size, texture are ex of design elements - design principles guide how those elements fit together.  
    balance - large vs small shapes.  
    contrast - light v dark, foreground v background, etc. visual interest, putting opposites side by side.  
    proximity - relationship between elements  
    alignment - allows for creation of unity and order connecting elements.  
    repetition - strengthens a design by tying together indiv. elements. ie. logo, color theme.  
    space - positive and negative space, very important. is distance or area between, around, about, below, or within elements

   accesibility - color-blindness, dyslexia - there are tools to help determine compliance with accessibility
