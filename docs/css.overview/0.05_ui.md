# User Interface

---

Its been mentioned before that UI is the visual communication of the path that the UX designer has laid out. More and more, these two roles are lumped together. 

## Design Fundamentals 

Shape, color, size, texture are examples of **design elements** - _design principles_ guide how those elements fit together.

* balance - large v small shapes
* contrast - light v dark, foreground v background
* visual interest, putting opposites side by side
* proximity - relationship between elements
* alignment - allows for creation of unity and order connecting elements.
* repetition - strengthens a design by tying together individual elements. ie. logo, color theme.
* space - positive and negative space, very important \(distance or area between, around, about, below, or within elements\)
* accesibility - color-blindness, dyslexia - there are tools to help determine compliance with accessibility
