# User Interface

---

user empathy and understanding are vital to the success of any product but especially so in regards to apps. Consider changing set of behaviors, preferences, goals, global cultural differences\(ex. Nova car\) **UI** and **UX** makes a product more useful, understandable, usable and beautiful.

user: who does user want to be? what does user want to do? how does user want to feel?

design fundamentals - shape, color, size, texture are ex of design elements - design principles guide how those elements fit together.  
    balance - large vs small shapes.  
    contrast - light v dark, foreground v background, etc. visual interest, putting opposites side by side.  
    proximity - relationship between elements  
    alignment - allows for creation of unity and order connecting elements.  
    repetition - strengthens a design by tying together indiv. elements. ie. logo, color theme.  
    space - positive and negative space, very important. is distance or area between, around, about, below, or within elements.

user-centered approach and iterative.

what is usability?

But it is important for back end developers to at least be aware of the presentation level, as it is important for front end to have knowledge of back end development to understand what is possible and how long something takes to code. Having this mutual awareness will make a more productive, efficient team.
