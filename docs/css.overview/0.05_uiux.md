# 0.05 UI & UX

---
A back end developer doesn't care about the presentation level of an application.  They care whether or not the application works the way they intended it to, that it successfully provides the user with the expected outcome.  But for an application to be successful it needs excellent UI and UX. What are UI and UX?  But it is important for back end developers to at least be aware of the presentation level, as it is important for front end to have knowledge of back end development to understand what is possible and how long something takes, so that they can incorporate it into how the code returns a results or operates. Having this mutual awareness will make a more productive, effiecient teams. 

Knowing a user will abandon an app within two(2) seconds at the least up to a few minutes you can see how vital a good presentation level is to the success of the application.

Take a look at the following applications and answer the questions below about each.

What was your first reaction?
What did you notice immediately?
What do you like about it?
What did you not like?
Was it easy to use it?

Now lets take each question individually.

What was your first reaction? (ui & ux) Did you like it? Did it make you cringe?

What did you notice immediately? (ui) Colors? Font type? font size? text (a lot? a little?)

What didn't you like? (if anything) (ui & ux)

How would you describe your experience? fun, miserable, frustrating, confused, angry, impatient, ugh?
It could be the most useful application but with a terrible UI and/or UX experience the user will ditch it faster than you can say "supercalifrulisticalidosious."

UI is User Interface. UX is User experience. What is the difference? UX overlaps with UI more than the reverse. UI is the graphics, colors,fonts but UX also deals with these. You will often see them lumped together in job applications. UX is how the user interacts with the application.

Open up this link (insert Taskly layout with bad UX).

You have just downloaded this application that you want to use as a time management app.

When you first open the app you are on the landing page. Do you understand what the app aims to do? Is it easy to log in? Is it easy to find help if you have questions? It is it easy to navigate?

Open your ElevenNote application that you built. Using the razor template produces a boring presentation level that doesn't really tell you what it does or what it is capable of doing. The form you fill out is ugly and cumbersome.

Or the Restaurant Rater application. It just gives you a list of restaurant names, address and rating. A list might be ok if there are only 10 restaurants listed but what if there are fifty(50, a hundred(100), thousands? You can imagine how tedious it would be to find a restaurant that you want to go to, or some restaurants in the list may never get noticed.

The youtube application you built.  Is it visually appealing? Do you like the font used? Do you like seeing all 10 of the search results at once?
 
If you were designing a bank app you would want colors that convey professionalism, responsibility, clarity.  If you were creating an educational app to help teach kids to spell it makes more sense to use bright colors, primary colors, a bigger font, more pictures, etc.

There are industry standards and best practices. We will introduce you to colors, wireframing, mood boards, user profiles but we will only scratch the surface.

Ever application has a landing page(which may also be the home page)


A user will abandon an application within two(2) to three(3) seconds of using it.
