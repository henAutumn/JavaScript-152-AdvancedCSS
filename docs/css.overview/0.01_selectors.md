# 0.02 Selectors and Combinators

---

Selectors allow developers to target specific HTML elements and apply stye to them. CSS specificity https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/
and
https://css-tricks.com/almanac/ (selectors and properties)

https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/

You are already familiar with class and id selectors
there are also
tag
attribute,
positional,
pseudo selectors.

'#' is ID selector
'.' is class selector

tag selector (ie div p h2)
attribute selector (same specificity value as classes)???

positional selectors(:nth-child(2), 3n = "every third")

pseudo elements and pseudo selectors are different

selectors can be combined together and selector combinators

child selector (>)
descendant selector (space)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Descendant selector (space)
    selects any that are anywhere in the markup structure.

```css
div p {
    background-color: purple;
}
```

Child selector (>)
    select only items one level down(direct) the markup structure
```css
div > p {
    background-color: purple;
}
```

Sibling elements must have the same parent element

adjacent means "immediately following"

Adjacent Sibling selector (+)
    *selects all elements that are the ad sib to specified element
    example: all <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements

```css
div + p {
    background-color: purple;
}
```

General Sibiling selector (~)
    *selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
    example: all <p> that are siblings of <div> elements

```css
div ~ p {
    background-color: purple;
}
```

example to illustrate child and sibling combinators.
