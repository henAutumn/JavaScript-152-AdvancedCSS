## Key **components of UX**

* **information architecture **

  1. how many pages are there and how are they arranged

  2. better to have shallow depth page to keep user clicks to a minimum.

  3. avoid information overload.

  4. keep it simple

* **navigation**

  1. how does the user flow through the pages

  2. interdependent of information architecture

  3. all the elements on a page that direct user flow

  4. users will ask  . . .

     1. where am I and how did I get here?

        1. breadcrumbs solves the first question

     2. where should I go next and how do I get there?

        1. This is the "call to action" \(CTA\) = the user's next step

* **interface **and** interaction**  
  1.  elements on page and how user actually interacts with them.  
  2.  hover, click, touch, type represents an interaction interface. \(voice/camera\)  
  3.  use established patterns  
  4.  be consistent  
  5.  draw the user's eye\(visual hierarchy\)  
  6.  provide feedback for interactions   
     1.  visual cue that something has happened.  
     2.  provide undo for all actions \(always have an 'oh shit' option or warning\)  
     3.  help users diagnose and recover from errors \(ex. seeing passwords as you type\)  
     4.  empower experienced users - give shortcuts where you can  
     5.  speak a user's language - keep conversational  
     6.  identify the next step - give user step forward\(ex. next button\)

* **kiss**

  1. just because its cool and/or flashy doesn't mean you should do i

  2. but animations are neat - just don't make it busy or nauseating

  3. Key words are minimal and simple.

* **usability**

  * user friendly \(leveraging data to determine the validity of design decisions. communication/pain points user feels during use of product\)
