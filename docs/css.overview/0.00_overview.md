# CSS OVERVIEW

---

You have an understanding of some basic CSS concepts such as; adjusting margins, padding, width, height, and adding color to your presentation to make it less blah and boring! But there is more, oh so much more, to CSS! In this module you will learn some more advanced tools to take the presentation of your app from Kansas to OZ!

---

Up until now you have been applying **inline styling**. We are going to move in to stylesheets which gives us more flexibility and control over applying styles across the application rather than targeting specific elements.

In this module we will cover the following topics and properties

* [ ] UI/UX
* [ ] measurements
* [ ] selectors
* [ ] flexbox
* [ ] grids
* [ ] borders
* [ ] shapes
* [ ] colors and gradients
* [ ] shadowing
* [ ] media queries
* [ ] transforms
* [ ] transitions
* [ ] animations

It is certainly not comprehensive and there are tools, and aspects of tools, that we won't cover but will provide you with links to some great references.

Each part will introduce 

* concept, 
* define properties and values
* provide example code to demonstrate. 
* Some modules will have challenges, practice code and opportunities to explore further. 

We will start with UI and UX, which will address the importance of having an inviting presentation level to you app. Then we'll go over selectors and measurements which are used frequently and across many tools.

This is really an intermediate course in CSS.  There is much more to CSS than what is contained here and much of what we do cover can be explored even further. Hopefully this gives you information and excites yoy enough to dig deeper or stay abreast of future happenings on the CSS future.
