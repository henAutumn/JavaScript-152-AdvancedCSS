# Part 7.0 Transitions

---
CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.
Animations that involve transitioning between two states are often called _implicit transitions_ as the states in between the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

The transition property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties:
```
.example {
    transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
}
```

##CSS Transition Properties

The following table lists all the CSS transition properties:

   | Property | Description
   | :-------- | :-----------
   | transition | A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into  a single property.
   | transition-delay | Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
   | transition-duration | Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition      effect takes to complete.
   | transition-property | Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition        effect is for.
   | transition-timing-function | Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
