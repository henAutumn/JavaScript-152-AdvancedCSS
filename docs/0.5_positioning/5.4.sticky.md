#### A _sticky_ element combines the values of _relative_ and _fixed_.

* starts with a position value of **relative**
* position value switches to **fixed** when it reaches a set scroll location

Make the following changes to the code.

```css
.squareGreen
    position: sticky;
    margin: 100px;
    top: -1;
```

Change class squareBlue to

```css
.barBlue{
position: relative;
width: 70em;
height: 100px;
margin: 0px;
background: #154360
}
```

Scroll up. Keep an eye on the squareGreen and barBlue. (ignore red bar red)
