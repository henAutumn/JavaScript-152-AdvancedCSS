# Part 2.1 GRADIENTS


## GRADIENTS

defined as the smooth transition between two or more colors

Using gradients is an easy way to add depth and dimension.  

paint a radial gradient in some shape at some size that is located in these postions and make sure it starts with this color and ends with this color.*


Terminology
creating gradients
color-stops: specify multiple in between color values called color-stops (combination of color and postion; used anywhere, i.e. background images, border images, list-style-type)

Fully responsive

3 types
linear, radial, conical(top to bottom, bottom to top, left to right, right to left, or along any arbirary axis)


Syntax
background-image: direction, starting color, color stops, end color) may want to include -webkit-to target webkit browsers

angles in degrees(deg) 0deg points upward, 90deg points toward right, etc in clockwise direction

key directional phrases:
    to top
    to bottom
    to left
    to right
    to top left
    to bottom left
    to top right
    to bottom right 
    
example: 
background-image: linear gradient(60deg, #000, #fff 75%, #000); 
note: color accepts hex, rgba and hsla

### Radial Gradients
circular or elliptical(default)
define the center of the gradient, size, shape and color stops. Color stops start in the center and proceed outward

example: background-image: radial-gradient(circle farthest-corner at center, #fff, #000);

default starting position is center of containing area

example: 
background-image: radial-gradient(dircle farthes-corner at 30px 30px, #fff, #000);

Size parameters
    closest-side(smallest)
    closest-corner
    farthest-side
    fathest-corner(largest)
    length or percentage (only for ellipses)
    
postion: top, right, left, center, or top center, bottom left, default is center

### Hard Color Stops
Useful for declaring a full-height background that simulates columns or stripes
example:
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #ffdc2, #ffdc2 15%, #d7f0a2 15%, #d7f0a2 85%, #ffdc2 85%);
